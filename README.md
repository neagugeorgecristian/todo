When working on the task, I took a mix of top-down and bottom-up approach. I started by envisioning the overall structure and flow of the application (top-down) and then delved into the details of implementing specific functionalities and managing state within the component (bottom-up). This blend of strategies aimed to ensure a well-rounded and functional end result, which I would be more than happy to further detail at the technical interview.
